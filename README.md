# MPC-Course
My exercises for my MPC course.

This dedicated course was given by Prof. Mazen Alamir. Its content can be found at https://www.mazenalamir.fr/MPC/.

The exercises were given in checkpoints, from 1 to 9. The questions are found on my professor's website. 

Here I put my codes and reports, i.e., my solutions and explanations to the checkpoints.
