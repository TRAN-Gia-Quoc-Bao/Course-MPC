# Exercises for MPC course

This dedicated course in Model Predictive Control (MPC) was given by Prof. Mazen Alamir, from September to November 2020. 

Its content can be found at https://www.mazenalamir.fr/MPC/.

The exercises were given in Checkpoints from 1 to 9. The questions are found on my professor's website. 

In the folders there are the links to the questions, my codes, and my reports, i.e., my solutions and explanations to the Checkpoints.

Contents:

1. Checkpoint 1: General questions regarding the introduction of the course

2. Checkpoint 2: General questions regarding the key variables in MPC formulations

3. Checkpoint 3: Programming a modified version of the simple integrator MPC

4. Checkpoint 4: Constructing the equality constraints representing the dynamics of LTI systems

5. Checkpoint 5: Constructing the quadratic cost function's matrices for LTI systems

6. Checkpoint 6: Designing unconstrained MPC solution for LTI systems

7. Checkpoint 7: Constructing the constraints matrices for LTI systems

8. Checkpoint 8: Implementing constrained MPC for LTI systems

9. Checkpoint 9: Implementing nonlinear constrained MPC using Casadi
