# Exercises for MPC course

This dedicated course was given by Prof. Mazen Alamir, from September to November 2020. 

Its content can be found at https://www.mazenalamir.fr/MPC/.

The exercises were given in checkpoints, from 1 to 9. The questions are found on my professor's website. 

In the folders there are the links to the questions, my codes, and my reports, i.e., my solutions and explanations to the checkpoints.
